# UnityAssetFetcher !WIP!
UnityAssetFetcher is a library that can be used in Unity to set properties to values not available at Editor time. **(for mod edition)**

# How to use
You can copy this repo's content directly into your Unity project (recommanded: in folder named AssetFetcher), once installed this should allow you to add **monobehaviours** inside Unity, allowing you to simply set references to scripts or other properties not available at the time.
